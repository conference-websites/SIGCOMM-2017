### Call For Participation

This half-day SIGCOMM tutorial provides an introduction to [Named Data Networking (NDN)](https://named-data.net/), a newly developed data-centric Internet architecture.
NDN makes a conceptually simple yet fundamental change to the narrow waist of the Internet's narrow waist architecture by replaces TCP/IP's narrow focus on "where" to send packet with "what" content to fetch. We believe that this shift to data-centric networking can greatly help enhance Internet security, enable mobility support, scale both data disseminations as well as data collection (e.g., from IoT devices), as well as facilitate new application developments.

The morning starts with an introduction of the NDN architecture by Van Jacobson, followed by research topics and recent results.

### Motivation

This half-day tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of [Named Data Networking (NDN)](https://named-data.net/), a newly developed Internet architecture. NDN replaces TCP/IP architecture's focus on "where", i.e., the addresses and hosts, with "what", i.e., the content that users and applications care about. This fundamental shift brings profound impacts to enhancing Internet security, enabling mobility support, scaling both data disseminations as well as data collection (e.g., from IoT devices), and facilitating new application development.

Launched in 2010 under the NSF's Future Internet Architecture program, the NDN project has attracted researchers from both academia and industry around the world to explore all aspects of its design, implementation, and applications.  It is arguably the most prominent inspiration and realization of the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) vision, around which a growing research community has formed over the past several years.

Together with an increasing interests in NDN, there are also a number of questions as well as misconceptions regarding NDN.  This tutorial aims to bring NDN to the broader networking community by explaining NDN's basic architectural concepts, articulating research issues, demonstrating NDN operations and applications, and introducing its open-source code development. We expect the tutorial to benefit network researchers and students with different levels of background knowledge on NDN/ICN, from people who want to learn what NDN really is, to people who are looking for new topics to explore, or for ways to contribute to NDN design and development.

The tutorial will start with an introduction to the NDN architecture by Van Jacobson, followed by an overview of the NDN research topics and recent results by the NDN project team researchers.

### Topics Include

- Introduction of the basic concepts, fundamental principles, key mechanisms, and articulation on how to take NDN to the next stage.

- Survey on existing NDN research work, with emphasis on research challenges and recent results, including

    - Routing
    - Forwarding
    - Caching
    - Mobility
    - Security
    - Applications

### Expected Audience and Prerequisites

This tutorial targets the general networking research community with no specific prerequisite. We expect the tutorial to benefit network researchers and students with different levels of background knowledge on NDN/ICN, from people who want to learn what NDN really is, to people who are looking for new topics to explore, or for ways to contribute to NDN design and development.
