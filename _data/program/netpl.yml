  title: Programmable Forwarding Planes are Here to Stay
  authors: Nick McKeown
  abstract: Many great research ideas and new languages are emerging for programmable
    forwarding. In this talk, I'll take a step back and consider how we got here,
    why programmable forwarding planes are inevitable, why now is the right time,
    why they are a final frontier for SDN, and why they are here to stay.

  title: 'For Good Measure: Programmable Measurement Using Emerging Switches'
  authors: Jennifer Rexford
  abstract: Large networks rely on timely and accurate measurements to detect unwanted
    traffic, diagnose performance problems, and optimize the use of resources. Emerging
    programmable forwarding planes are a "game changer" for answering sophisticated
    measurement questions directly inside the network, rather than shipping reams
    of data to a remote collector for subsequent analysis. Capitalizing on these new
    switch capabilities requires innovation in rich, high-level query abstractions
    as well as runtime systems that can generate efficient data structures for streaming
    analytics at line rate.

  title: 'Programming Network Policies by Examples: Platform, Abstraction, and User
    Studies'
  authors: Boon Thau Loo
  abstract: NetEgg is a scenario-based programming toolkit that allows network operators
    to program network policies by describing representative example behaviors. Given
    these scenarios, a synthesis algorithm automatically infers the controller state
    that needs to be maintained along with the rules to process network events and
    update state. NetEgg executes the generated policy implementation on top of a
    centralized controller, and automatically infers flow-table rules that can be
    pushed to switches to improve throughput. This talk will present the design and
    implementation of the NetEgg toolkit, empirical results on multiple example policies,
    and experiences on running controlled user studies. The talk concludes with a
    discussion on the importance of controlled user studies in evaluating new programming
    languages in the networking domain and the lessons we learnt in the process.

  title: Abstractions for Safety of Stateful Networks
  authors: Mooly Sagiv
  abstract: "<p>Modern networks store states at individual nodes. This allows the
    forwarding behavior to change over time, which is useful to implement many kinds
    of functionalities for performance and security. However, this makes the task
    of network programming hard and error-prone. I will describe several abstractions
    that simplify the task of proving the safety of stateful networks. The abstraction
    include modelling state changes as a finite-state machine, ignoring the order
    of packet receival, and assuming that nodes can non-deterministically reset to
    their initial states. I will show that these abstractions reduce the asymptotic
    complexity of network verification.</p> \n<p>This is a joint work with Kalev Alpernas

    (TAU), Yaron Velner (HUJI)</p>"

  title: Verifying networks with symbolic execution and temporal logic
  authors: Matei Popovici, Radu Stoenescu, Lorina Negreanu, Costin Raiciu (University
    Politehnica of Bucharest)
  abstract: We introduce NetCTL, a language designed for expressing and verifying
    network operator policies. NetCTL can be deployed on arbitrary network infrastructures.
    It relies on performing symbolic execution on a model of the network at hand in
    order to prove policy compliance or violation. We have implemented NetCTL verification
    as an extension to the Symnet symbolic execution engine.

  title: Towards An Auditing Language for Preventing Cascading Failures
  authors: Ennan Zhai, Ruzica Piskac (Yale University)
  abstract: In this paper, we present the basic ideas behind a framework RepAudit
    for preventing cascading failures. RepAudit helps administrators to identify potential
    root causes resulting in cascading failures at an early stage, i.e., before service
    outages occur. To the best of our knowledge, RepAudit is the first effort capable
    of simultaneously achieving expressive, efficient, and accurate structural reliability
    auditing to cloud systems.

  title: Network Protocol Programming in Haskell
  authors: Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Internet Initiative Japan Inc.)
  abstract: Over seven years, we have developed several network protocol libraries
    including anti-spam, DNS, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3 in Haskell. Based on these
    experiences, we regard Haskell as a safe and highly-concurrent network programming
    language thanks to its strong type system and lightweight threads (i.e. green
    threads). This paper describes advantages and disadvantages of Haskell and reports
    our experiences.

  title: Dynamic Compilation and Optimization of Packet Processing Programs
  authors: Gábor Rétvári (Budapest University of Technology and Economics); László
    Molnár, Gábor Enyedi, Gergely Pongrácz (TrafficLab, Ericsson Research)
  abstract: Data plane compilation is a transformation from a high-level description
    of the intended packet processing functionality to the underlying data plane architecture.
    Compilation in this setting is usually done statically, i.e., the input of the
    compiler is a fixed description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output
    is code that can accommodate any packet processing behavior set by the controller
    at runtime. Below we advocate a dynamic approach to data plane compilation instead,
    where not just the semantics but the intended behavior is also also input to the
    compiler. We point out a handful of runtime optimization opportunities that can
    be leveraged to improve the performance of custom-compiled datapaths beyond what
    is possible in a static setting.

  title: Toward building memory-safe network functions with modest performance overhead
  authors: Keunhong Lee, Shinae Woo (KAIST); Sanghyeon Seo (Hyperconnect, Inc.); Jihyeok
    Park, Sukyoung Ryu, Sue Moon (KAIST)
  abstract: For the past few decades network functions have evolved much in variety
    and complexity. Network functions rely heavily on low-level memory management
    to deliver high performance but such memory management is error-prone. Rust, a
    recently developed language for safe system programming, aims to support memory-safety
    with modest performance overhead. In this work we build network functions in Rust,
    with type-safe guarantees and modest performance overhead.

  title: Mapping Programmable Network Packet Pipelines to HMC-Enabled FPGAs
  authors: Jehandad Khan, Peter Athanas (Virgina Tech)
  abstract: A higher tier of network packet processing performance can be achieved
    by augmenting the agility FPGAs offer with the sheer streaming throughput of a
    Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). The notion of a programmable data plane specified in
    a domain-specific language enables the creation of custom protocol and packet
    operations. This paper presents an effort to map one such domain specific language,
    namely P4 (Protocol Independent Packet Processing) to an HMC-enabled FPGA platform
    by using HLS as the intermediate representation. The use of HLS affords productivity
    advantages as well as enabling a close correlation between the P4 code and the
    corresponding hardware units required to achieve the functionality. The resulting
    code leverages the parallel nature of the HMC to yield a packet pipeline capable
    of delivering 30 million packets per second (Mpps) using only a single HMC channel,
    which translates to 30 Gbps of data throughput for a Layer-3 router with an average
    of 128-byte long packets. Demonstrated here, by using 10 HMC user channels, the
    system is capable of achieving 300 Mpps (or 300 Gbps) of throughput. Comparisons
    with other P4 to FPGA endeavors, as well as with CPUs and GPUs, indicate that
    the proposed system achieves equal or higher performance and lower power while
    enabling much higher table scale and overall system simplicity.

  title: Network Verification in the Real World
  authors: Wenxuan Zhou (Veriflow / UIUC)
  abstract: |-
    <p>Enterprise networks have become complex software artifacts weaving together interdependent devices, protocols, virtualization layers, optimizations, software bugs, and security controls. Yet communication is now critical infrastructure. How can we be sure networks are doing the right thing? The fact is, too often, they aren't. Despite enormous amounts of manual effort, outages and security vulnerabilities are common.</p>
    <p>Can we prove that a network is correct? This is the goal of the emerging area of network verification, which applies ideas of formal methods to network infrastructure. From its recent genesis in the research community, network verification blossomed into a hot area of research and quickly had impact on industry, with startups and hyperscale cloud providers deploying verification technology today. In this talk, we'll briefly review key research advances that influenced industrial verification software. Then, based on experience with production deployments, we will discuss what principles of verification persevered, what surprises we encountered, and how verification is solving problems in the real world. Finally, we will discuss challenging future research directions.</p>
