    Yi Wang (Future Network Theory Lab, Huawei, Hong Kong, China), Chen Tian (State
    Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China), Bo Jin
    (Future Network Theory Lab, Huawei, Hong Kong, China), Hao Yin (Department of
    Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China), and Gong Zhang (Future Network
    Theory Lab, Huawei, Hong Kong, China)
  abstract: "<p>Enforce virtualized congestion control is a new trend for datacenter
    networks. Virtual Congestion Control (VCC) can also enforce differentiated Quality-of-Service
    (QoS) for flows. However, current flow differentiation algorithm only provides
    qualitative rather than quantitative bandwidth allocation. Weighted bandwidth
    allocation is critical to enforce administrator policy. In this work, we propose
    Weighted Virtual Congestion Control (WVCC) enforcement for datacenter networks.
    It is a novel per-flow differentiation mechanism capable of proportionally allocating
    bandwidth among flows.</p>\n"

  title: '3D Fabric: Differential Deceleration and Detour for Congestion Free Data
    Center Networks'
  authors: Haoyu Song (Futurewei Technologies, Santa Clara) and Zhigang Ji, Yali Zhang,
    and Yinben Xia (Huawei IP Network Research Department, Beijing)
  abstract: "<p>3D Fabric, a new data center network algorithm, jointly uses two strategies
    for congestion avoidance: flow rate adjustment and path switch. 3D Fabric predicts
    flow’s size and only decelerates large flows in case of light congestion. When
    the network is heavily congested, it starts to decelerate small flows as well,
    and meanwhile, considers to switch large flow’s path. 3D Fabric makes novel contributions
    such as a new artificial flowlet generation method for load balancing which avoids
    packet reordering. As a network-based solution, 3D Fabric does not modify the
    end host’s application and protocol stack and makes no assumption on the network
    topology. The main algorithm can be implemented in virtual switch, NIC, or ToR
    switch. ns-3 simulation shows 3D Fabric’s FCT outperforms DCTCP by more than 50%
    for small flows and 3% for large flows with low implementation cost.</p>"

  title: Authentication-Bypass Vulnerabilities in SOHO Routers
  authors: Nadav Rotenberg (HUJI), Haya Shulman and Michael Waidner (Fraunhofer SIT
    and HUJI), and Benjamin Zeltser (HUJI)
  abstract: "<p>SOHO routers act as a gateway to the Internet for Small Office/Home
    Office networks. They typically run a firewall to filter potentially malicious
    traffic, and operate services such as NAT, DNS, DHCP, and web proxy. Despite the
    important role that they fulfill, there is a long history of vulnerabilities allowing
    attackers to breach security and availability of the clients and services on SOHO
    networks. Following the multiple disclosures and recommendations for patches in
    the last two decades it seems an obvious question to verify whether the reality
    meets the expectation. We focus on an important class of vulnerabilities called
    ‘authentication bypass’, which allow an attacker to take control over a network
    device by subverting the authentication procedure. To that end, we perform a stealthy
    and non disruptive Internet scale evaluation of authentication bypass vulnerabilities
    in SOHO routers. We systematically scanned portions of the Internet, focusing
    on a number of selected countries, to detect presence of vulnerable devices. The
    results of our study are worrisome: we find a large fraction of misconfigurations
    and insecurity issues in configuration of SOHO routers, which stand in sharp contrast
    to the awareness of the security and research communities to the vulnerabilities
    as well as a large body of work studying related topics.</p>\n"

  title: 'Cognitive IoT Gateways: Automatic Task Sharing and Switching between Cloud
    and Edge/Fog Computing'
  authors: Fatemeh Jalali, Olivia Smith, Timothy Lynar, and Frank Suits (IBM Research)
  abstract: "<p>Fog computing, also known as Edge computing, is an emerging computational
    paradigm, increasingly utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly
    those that cannot be served efficiently using Cloud computing due to limitations
    such as bandwidth, latency, Internet connectivity. At present, the norm is the
    static allocation of tasks by developers of an application, where some IoT applications
    are allocated to be performed on the Cloud, some on the Fog, and some on a hybrid
    Cloud-Fog. The applications are pre-programmed and predefined to be run on a platform,
    and this is unchangeable at run-time. IoT gateways, which are devices that bridge
    the IoT local network and the Internet, are in a position to make dynamic adjustments
    and allocation decision between platforms based upon real-time conditions such
    as an IoT applications’ performance. However, currently there is no (or very little)
    intelligence embedded into IoT gateways. This paper proposes cognitive IoT gateways
    powered by cognitive analytics and data mining techniques to improve the performance
    of IoT applications. These IoT devices are able to automatically learn and decide
    when and where to run an application, be that on the Cloud or on the Fog. The
    dynamic task sharing and platform interchanging will enable the IoT applications
    to be optimized for multiple objectives including task performance.</p>\n"

  title: Towards Zero Copy Dataflows using RDMA
  authors: Bairen Yi, Jiacheng Xia, Li Chen, and Kai Chen (HKUST)
  abstract: "<p>Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offers ultra-low latency and CPU
    bypass networking to application programmers. Existing applications are often
    designed around socket based software stack that manages application buffers separately
    from networking buffers and do memory copies between them when sending/receiving
    data. With large sized (up to hundreds MB) application buffers, the overhead of
    such copies adds non trivial overhead to the end-to-end communication pipeline.
    In this work, we made an attempt to design a zero copy transport for distribute
    dataflow frameworks that unifies application and networking buffer management
    and completely eliminates unnecessary memory copies. Our prototype on top of TensorFlow
    shows 2.43x performance improvement over gRPC based transport and 1.21x performance
    improvement over an alternative RDMA transport with private buffers and memory
    copies.</p>\n"

  title: 'LDplayer: DNS Experimentation at Scale'
  authors: Liang Zhu and John Heidemann (USC/Information Sciences Institute)
  abstract: "<p>In the last 20 years the core of the Domain Name System (DNS) has
    improved in security and privacy, and DNS use broadened from name-to-address mapping
    to a critical roles in service discovery and anti-spam. However, protocol evolution
    and expansion of use has been slow because advances must consider a huge and diverse
    installed base. We suggest that experimentation at scale can fill this gap. To
    meet the need for experimentation at scale, this paper presents LDplayer, a configurable,
    general-purpose DNS testbed. LDplayer enables DNS experiments to scale in several
    dimensions: many zones, multiple levels of DNS hierarchy, high query rates, and
    diverse query sources. To meet these requirements while providing high fidelity
    experiments, LDplayer includes a distributed DNS query replay system and methods
    to rebuild the relevant DNS hierarchy from traces. We show that a single DNS server
    can correctly emulate multiple independent levels of the DNS hierarchy while providing
    correct responses as if they were independent. We show the importance of our system
    to evaluate pressing DNS design questions, using it to evaluate changes in DNSSEC
    key size.</p>\n"

  title: Use of Cuckoo Filters with FD.io VPP for Software IPv6 Routing Lookup
  authors: Minseok Kwon, Shailesh Vajpayee, Pragash Vijayaragavan, and Arjun Dhuliya
    (Rochester Institute of Technology) and John Marshall (Cisco Systems, Inc.)
  abstract: "<p>The filter technologies, e.g., Bloom filters, have been used for IP
    lookup for their compactness and efficiency. We investigate the performance of
    cuckoo filters with Cisco’s VPP (Vector Packet Processing) for IP lookup. We also
    introduce a variant called a length-aware cuckoo filter that treats incoming IP
    addresses discriminatively, and study its performance with VPP. As proof-of-concept,
    we implement cuckoo filters with VPP, and test them on both functions and performance
    with focus on the ip6-input node in VPP.</p>\n"

  title: Cooperative Active Distribution of Videos in Telco-CDNs
  authors: Khaled Diab and Mohamed Hefeeda (Simon Fraser University)
  abstract: "<p>Telco-CDNs are ISP-managed CDNs deployed inside ISP networks. We propose
    a new content distribution system inside telco-CDN called CAD. In CAD, Content
    Provider and ISP collaborate to distribute multimedia content to users inside
    the ISP network. CAD manages both the overlay and underlay of the network to reduce
    the ISP interdomain traffic, improve the service latency, and minimize the intradomain
    link utilization. CAD achieves these goals by allowing caching servers to fetch
    content from other caching servers, and create videos on-demand inside the telco-CDN.
    We propose an algorithm to calculate the overlay and underlay of the CAD-managed
    telco-CDN in polynomial time. Compared against the closest approach in the literature,
    our initial results showed that CAD achieves up to 30% reduction in the interdomain
    traffic and up to 230% improvement in the service latency, while not increasing
    the intradomain link utilization.</p>"

    there is little work in understanding the hardware bottlenecks in page load process.
    In this poster, we analyze the effect of hardware bottlenecks of Web pages. We
    also analyze the effect of GPU offloading, a commonly used solution to speed up

  title: 'The Root Canary: Monitoring and Measuring the DNSSEC Root Key Rollover'
  authors: Roland van Rijswijk-Deij (University of Twente), Taejoong Chung, David
    Choffnes, and Alan Mislove (Northeastern University), and Willem Toorop (NLnet
    Labs)
  abstract: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet.
    Over the past decade, much-needed security features were added to this protocol,
    with the introduction of the DNS Security Extensions. DNSSEC adds authenticity
    and integrity to the protocol using digital signatures, and turns the DNS into
    a public key infrastructure (PKI). At the top of this PKI is a single key, the
    so-called Key Signing Key (KSK) for the DNS root. The current Root KSK was introduced
    in 2010, and has not changed since. This year, the Root KSK will be replaced for
    the rst time ever. This event potentially has a major impact on the Internet.
    Thousands of DNS resolvers worldwide rely on this key to validate DNSSEC signatures,
    and must start using the new key, either through an automated process, or manual
    intervention. Failure to pick up the new key will result in resolvers becoming
    completely unavailable to end users. This work presents the “Root Canary”, a system
    to monitor and measure this event from the perspective of validating DNS resolvers
    for its entire nine-month duration. The system combines three active measurement
    platforms to have the broadest possible coverage of validating resolvers. Results
    will be presented in near real-time, to allow the global DNS community to act
    if problems arise. Furthermore, after the Root KSK rollover concludes in March
    2018, we will use the recorded datasets for an in-depth analysis, from which the
    Internet community can draw lessons for future key rollovers.</p>\n"

  title: Rethinking TCP Throughput and Latency Modeling
  authors: Yi Cao, Aruna Balasubramanian, and Anshul Gandhi (Stony Brook University)
  abstract: "<p>TCP throughput and latency models are useful tools to characterize
    the TCP performance. The canonical throughput model, while useful, has some limitations
    since it does not consider how packet loss rate changes over time. This approach
    leads to poor predictions for short flows. We present a new modeling approach
    that characterizes the throughput and latency models by: (i) discovering the relationship
    between the packet loss rate and the congestion window size, and (ii) incorporating
    the starting congestion window and the number of parallel connections. Experimental
    results show that our models significantly improve modeling accuracy.</p>\n"

    are especially beneficial. However, they still suffer from a lack of tools to

    x86 and ARM and does not requires any code changes or instrumentation. Its high
    speed and low overhead (0.1% at 100 samples/s) makes it usable even in production
    environments, allowing the collection of realistic and highly credible data.</p>\n"

  title: Privacy-Preserving Detection of Inter-Domain SDN Rules Overlaps
  authors: Arnaud Dethise (KAUST, Université catholique de Louvain), Marco Chiesa
    (Université catholique de Louvain), and Marco Canini (KAUST)
  abstract: |
    <p>SDN approaches to inter-domain routing promise better traffic engineering, enhanced security, and higher automation. Yet, naive deployment of SDN on the Internet is dangerous as the control-plane expressiveness of BGP is significantly more limited than the data-plane expressiveness of SDN, which allows fine-grained rules to deflect traffic from BGP’s default routes. Most notably, this mismatch may lead to incorrect forwarding behaviors such as forwarding loops and blackholes, ultimately hindering SDN deployment at the inter-domain level.</p>
    <p>In this work, we make a first step towards verifying the correctness of inter-domain forwarding state with a focus on loop freedom while keeping private the SDN rules, as they comprise confidential routing information. To this end, we design a simple yet powerful primitive that allows two networks to verify whether their SDN rules overlap, i.e., the set of packets matched by these rules is non-empty, without leaking any information about the SDN rules. We propose an efficient implementation of this primitive by using recent advancements in Secure Multi-Party Computation and we then leverage it as the main building block for designing a system that detects Internet-wide forwarding loops among any set of SDN-enabled Internet eXchange Points.</p>

  title: 'BLOP: Batch-Level Order Preserving for GPU-Accelerated Packet Processing'
  authors: Zhilong Zheng, Jun Bi, Heng Yu, Chen Sun, and Jianping Wu (Tsinghua University)
  abstract: "<p>We propose BLOP, a Batch-Level Order Preserving framework for GPU-accelerated
    packet processing. We first study the extent of batch-level out-of-order (up to
    26.1%) based on experiments as the motivation for BLOP. Then we propose two key
    observations including (1) packet order is strictly maintained inside a batch,
    and (2) the difference of processing time between core blocks are small and could
    entangle very few batches. Finally, we carefully design the BLOP framework for
    enhanced order preserving. BLOP lightly tags batches in CPU before sending them
    to GPU, and efficiently reorders batches in CPU after GPU processing. Evaluations
    demonstrate that BLOP could achieve order preserving with little performance overhead.</p>"

  title: Enabling Fine-Grained Edge Offloading for IoT
  authors: Vittorio Cozzolino, Aaron Yi Ding, and Jörg Ott (Technical University of

  abstract: "<p>In this paper we make the case for IoT edge offloading, which strives

    computation tasks from the cloud closer to the users and data generators (i.e.,

    IoT services. Our proposal bridges the gap between cloud computing and IoT by
    applying a <em>divide and conquer</em> approach over the multi-level (cloud, edge
    and IoT) information pipeline. To validate the design of IoT edge offloading,
    we developed a unikernel-based prototype and evaluated the system under various
    hardware and network conditions. Our experimentation has shown promising results
    and revealed the limitation of existing IoT hardware and virtualization platforms,
    shedding light on future research of edge computing and IoT.</p>\n"

  title: 'TCP Proxy Bypass: all the gain with no pain!'
  authors: Giuseppe Siracusano (University of Rome, Tor Vergata), Roberto Bifulco
    (NEC Laboratories Europe), and Stefano Salsano (University of Rome, Tor Vergata)
  abstract: "<p>TCP proxies are widely deployed in modern networks and, sitting on
    the network connections’ data path, their efficiency is critical to systems’ cost
    and performance. In many cases, the proxy is only required during the initial
    phases of a network connection, becoming just a relay during the later stages,
    until the connection is finally closed. For example, TCP proxies reading the HTTP
    request header may require to access only the first few packets of a connection.
    In this paper, we focus on these cases and try to answer the following question:can
    established connections be offloaded from the TCP proxy? Our goal is to save precious
    resources by transparently removing the TCP proxy from the data path,when the
    proxy’s operations are limited to relaying packets.</p>\n"

  title: A Case for Information Centric Networking For Smart Grid Communications
  authors: Dan Ameme, Satyajayant Misra, and Abderrahmen Mtibaa (New Mexico State
    University)
  abstract: "<p>The smart grid, with its large array of networked devices and bidirectional
    data flow between the end-users and the grid, presents new requirements in service
    reliability, communication latency, and data delivery. The traditional TCP/IP
    communication paradigm was not designed to handle these requirements at the envisioned
    scale. This calls for a novel networking paradigm. This paper makes the case for
    the use of the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm to create the smart
    grid network architecture. We quantitatively assess the gains resulting from ICN’s
    inherent functionalities, such as concurrent use of multiple interfaces, request
    aggregation, and stateful forwarding, which enable timely critical message delivery

    smart grid deployments. Our results show that the ICN-based solution outperforms
    the IP-based solution, especially in a network with packet losses.</p>\n"

  title: 'AS hegemony: A Robust Metric for AS Centrality'
  authors: Romain Fontugne (IIJ Research Lab), Anant Shah (Colorado State University),
    and Emile Aben (RIPE NCC)
  abstract: "<p>Inter-domain routing anomalies happen on a daily basis and are potential
    sources of great troubles for Internet users. The origins of these anomalies are
    diverse, ranging from operator mistakes to malicious activities. To monitor significant
    routing changes network operators rely on tools (e.g.bgpmon.net) that implements
    complex heuristics based on AS business relationship, geo info, whois, etc. But
    these tools are generally hard to maintain as they require constant updates and
    fine tuning. The goal of this ongoing research is to design systematic methods
    to identify abnormal routing changes from BGP data. Our first step is to define
    a set of discriminative features to monitor the role of each AS for inter-domain
    routing. We are particularly interested in quantifying the likelihood of an AS
    to lie on paths between two other ASes, also known as AS centrality. Significant
    changes in AS centrality are strong evidences of structural routing changes that
    might be undesirable. In the literature AS centrality is commonly measured using
    Betweenness Centrality (BC). For example, BC enabled researchers to monitor critical
    ASes at country-level [5], detect disruptive events [2], and select targets for
    control plane attacks [4]. However, in this paper, we report fundamental shortcomings
    of BC when used with BGP data (§2), consequently we propose a new centrality metric
    called AS hegemony (§3).</p>\n"

    Telecom), Gareth Tyson (Queen Mary University of London), and Jon Crowcroft (University
    of Cambridge)
  abstract: "<p>The explosion of bots on the Web brings an unprecedented increase
    in traffic from non-human sources. This work studies bot traffic on Twitter, finding
    that almost 50% of traffic is generated and propagated by a rapidly growing bot
    population - a major concern for networked systems in the future.</p>"

  title: Sandboxing Data Plane Programs for Fun and Profit
  authors: Miguel Neves (UFRGS), Kirill Levchenko (UC San Diego), and Marinho Barcellos
    (UFRGS)
  abstract: "<p>This paper describes the design and implementation of a general-purpose
    compile-time sandbox for P4 data plane programs. Our mechanism allows a supervisor
    to interpose on another program’s interaction with the forwarding device. The
    sandboxing technique we use provides also a powerful new program structuring model,
    allowing a data plane developer to combine crosscutting program modules in a safe
    way. To demonstrate the capabilities of our construct, we describe the implementation
    of a data plane security kernel that enforces end host isolation policies on top
    of a programmable data plane.</p>\n"

  title: 'Gather: A Way to Optimize the Routing Process of In-band Control Network'
  authors: Yabo Yan (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications) and Jun Bi,
    Yu Zhou, and Cheng Zhang (Tsinghua University)
  abstract: "<p>Nowadays, the in-band way of implementing SDN control network has
    received much attention for its feasibility in distributed deployment as well
    as the cost effectiveness. However, to maintain such in-band control network,
    every switch has to statically pre-store a large number of flow entries to keep
    the control channels between switches and the controller. Consequently, this way
    of implementing the in-band control network suffers from a serious waste of network
    resources such as the TCAM and great complexity of network management. In this
    paper, We propose Gather, an optimized routing mechanism for controllers to manage
    the in-band control network with better utilization efficiency of memory resources.
    Experiment results show that our design can usually reduce 45% to 55% of the overall
    flow entries in our test topologies. Meanwhile, the increased delay imposed by
    our optimization on the network is less than 5%.</p>"

  title: Time Synchronization in a Network of Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons
  authors: Farzad Asgarian and Khalil Najafi (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)
  abstract: "<p>Time synchronization is a vital feature in many wireless sensor networks
    with applications ranging from structural health monitoring systems to body area
    sensors used for rehabilitation and sport medicine. While different wireless protocols
    have been utilized in sensor networks, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has drawn a
    lot of attention in the past years due to its low-power architecture and availability
    in many consumer electronics. Moreover, the added non-connectable beacon mode
    has increased its functionality for Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor fusion.
    However, in this mode as devices are not paired with each other no synchronization
    service is available. In this paper, we present a synchronization protocol based
    on BLE beacons that can be used in conjunction with BLE software stacks provided
    with a commercial Bluetooth System-on-Chip (SoC). Offset and frequency-drift estimation
    techniques are discussed, and the effects of number of synchronization packets
    and their intervals on the overall synchronization accuracy are investigated.
    Experimental results show that without any re-synchronization in ten minutes,
    average synchronization errors of less than 350 ns per minute (single hop) can
    be achieved.</p>\n"

  title: 'CacheP4: A Behavior-level Caching Mechanism for P4'
  authors: Zijun Ma, Jun Bi, Cheng Zhang, Yu Zhou, and Abdul Basit Dogar (Tsinghua
    University)
  abstract: "<p>In recent times, the P4 programming language has been proposed as
    a domain specific language for programmable data planes. However, room for further
    optimization of faster packet processing remains in P4. In this poster, we propose
    CacheP4, a behavior-level caching mechanism for P4, which (1) adds match+action
    tables (MATs) as the cache to P4 programs and (2) allows the control plane to
    dynamically update cache content by repopulating cache MATs during the runtime.
    Experiments on BMv2 target with typical P4 programs indicate that CacheP4 could
    achieve a latency decrease over 20% and a throughput increase over 60%.</p>"

  title: 'TIDE: Threat Identification Using Active DNS Measurements'
  authors: Anna Sperotto, Olivier van der Toorn, and Roland van Rijswijk-Deij (University
    of Twente)
  abstract: "<p>The Domain Name System contains a wealth of information about the
    security, stability and health of the Internet. Most research that leverages the
    DNS for detection of malicious activities does so by using passive measurements.
    The limitation of this approach, however, is that it is effective only once an
    attack is ongoing. In this paper, we explore a different approach. We advocate
    the use of active DNS measurements for pro-active (i.e., before the actual attack)
    identification of domains set up for malicious use. Our research makes uses of
    data from the OpenINTEL large-scale active DNS measurement platform, which, since
    February 2015, collects daily snapshots of currently more than 60% of the DNS
    namespace. We illustrate the potential of our approach by showing preliminary
    results in three case studies, namely snowshoe spam, denial of service attacks
    and a case of targeted phishing known as CEO fraud.</p>"
