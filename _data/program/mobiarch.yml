  title: 'Keynote 1: Collaborative Mobile Charging: From Abstraction to Solution'
  authors: |-

    Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University
  abstract: Wireless energy charging using mobile vehicles has been a viable research
    topic recently in the area of wireless networks and mobile computing. This talk
    gives a short survey of recent research conducted in our research group in the
    area of collaborative mobile charging. In collaborative mobile charging, multiple
    mobile chargers work together to accomplish a given set of objectives. These objectives
    include charging sensors at different frequencies with a minimum number of mobile
    chargers and reaching the farthest sensor for a given set of mobile chargers,
    subject to various constraints, including speed and energy limits of mobile chargers.
    Through the process of problem formulation, solution construction, and future
    work extension for problems related to collaborative mobile charging and coverage,
    we present three principles for good practice in conducting research, that is,
    select a simple problem, find an elegant solution, and use imagination for extension.

  title: 'BlueSkyNet: BLE Multi-Hop Network Management Architecture'
  authors: Makito Kano (Intel Corporation)
  abstract: "<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is aimed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    with limited battery capacity and small bandwidth. Despite the increasing number
    of IoT devices and the improving performance of BLE, the usage model is still
    limited to point-to-point with no mobility. This limitation prevents the devices
    to spread across a large field or a home. While multi-hop technologies had been
    studied and commercialized, they do not fully take advantage of the BLE’s low-power
    feature; and their configurations cannot easily be changed once the network is
    deployed. We have designed an architecture called BlueSkyNet. It allows network
    administrators to form and manage a BLE multi-hop network that allows nodes to
    be mobile. It takes advantage of the improving performance of BLE, and allows
    the network configurations to be modified in a software-defined way.</p>\n"

  title: A NEAT Approach to Mobile Communication
  authors: Per Hurtig, Stefan Alfredsson, and Anna Brunstrom (Karlstad University),
    Kristian Evensen (Celerway Communications), Karl-Johan Grinnemo (Karlstad University),
    and Audun Fosselie Hansen and Tomasz Rozensztrauch (Celerway Communications)
  abstract: "<p>The demands for mobile communication is ever increasing. Mobile applications
    are increasing both in numbers and in heterogeneity of their requirements, and
    an increasingly diverse set of mobile technologies are employed. This creates
    an urgent need for optimizing end-to-end services based on application requirements,
    conditions in the network and available transport solutions; something which is
    very hard to achieve with today’s internet architecture. In this paper, we introduce
    the NEAT transport architecture as a solution to this problem. NEAT is designed
    to offer a flexible and evolvable transport system, where applications communicate
    their transport-service requirements to the NEAT system in a generic, transport-protocol
    independent way. The best transport option is then configured at run-time based
    on application requirements, network conditions, and available transport options.
    Through a set of real life mobile use case experiments, we demonstrate how applications
    with different properties and requirements could employ the NEAT system in multi-access
    environments, showing significant performance benefits as a result.</p>\n"

  title: Popularity-aware Intra-domain Mobility Management
  authors: Vasilios A. Siris (Athens University of Economics and Business)
  abstract: "<p>We present and evaluate a popularity-aware intra-domain mobile content
    management model based on which the Name Resolution System (NRS) is updated with
    the current location of mobile content only when the content has sufficiently
    high popularity and sufficiently low mobility. Specifically, the current location
    of mobile content is updated only when the overall cost of location updates is
    smaller than the cost of broadcasting location queries. On the other hand, the
    location of content with low popularity and high mobility that is not tracked
    by the NRS is discovered by broadcasting location queries. Our evaluation investigates
    how the performance gains of the proposed model, in terms of reduced total signaling
    cost and reduced memory requirements of the NRS, depend on the aggregate content
    request rate, content mobility (rate of content location changes), number of content
    objects, content popularity, and correlation between content popularity and mobility.</p>\n"

  title: A Robust Sign Language Recognition System with Multiple Wi-Fi Devices
  authors: Jiacheng Shang and Jie Wu (Temple University)
  abstract: "<p>Sign language is important since it provides a way for us to the deaf
    culture and more opportunities to communicate with those who are deaf or hard
    of hearing. Since sign language chiefly uses body languages to convey meaning,
    Human Activity Recognition (HAR) techniques can be used to recognize them for
    some sign language translation applications. In this paper, we show for the first
    time that Wi-Fi signals can be used to recognize sign language. The key intuition
    is that different hand and arm motions introduce different multi-path distortions
    in Wi-Fi signals and generate different unique patterns in the time-series of
    Channel State Information (CSI). More specifically, we propose a Wi-Fi signal-based
    sign language recognition system called WiSign. Different from existing Wi-Fi
    signal-based human activity recognition systems, WiSign uses 3 Wi-Fi devices to
    improve the recognition performance. We implemented the WiSign using a TP-Link
    TL-WR1043ND Wi-Fi router and two Lenovo X100e laptops. The evaluation results
    show that our system can achieve a mean prediction accuracy of 93.8</p>\n"

  title: 'Privacy-preserving Quantified Self: Secure Sharing and Processing of Encrypted
    Small Data'
  authors: Hossein Shafagh and Anwar Hithnawi (ETH Zurich)
  abstract: "<p>The emergence of a plethora of wearables and sensing technologies
    has enabled non-intrusive digitization of our daily physical activities. Emerging
    applications utilize such data to make inferences about our physiological and
    health states, provide health diagnosis, and contribute to wellbeing improvements.
    The common approach for such applications is to collect data, either using mobile
    applications or special hardware, e.g., wearables, and store them on a third party
    storage provider. This results in many unconnected data silos of self-quantification
    data. Researchers and industry, advocate for a common personal storage space,
    to conquer the myriad of small chunks of data, deemed to be lost/forgotten in
    the long term. The benefits of such co-located personal data are tremendous, specifically
    with regards to personalized medicine, treatment, and health care. However, the
    centralized storage of data exacerbates the privacy and security concerns that
    the IoT ecosystem is facing today. In this position paper, we advocate the necessity
    of privacy and security guarantees for the paradigm of co-located storage of personal
    health data. We envision two core security functionalities: true end-to-end encryption,
    such that only encrypted data is stored in the cloud and secure sharing of encrypted
    data, without disclosing data owner’s secret keys. We discuss the challenges in
    adopting such an end-to-end encryption paradigm while preserving the cloud’s basic
    processing functionalities over encrypted data and how to cryptographically enforce
    access control.</p>\n"

  title: 'DICE: Dynamic Multi-RAT Selection in the ICN-enabled Wireless Edge'
  authors: Gaurav Panwar, Reza Tourani, Travis Mick, Abderrahmen Mtibaa, and Satyajayant
    Misra (New Mexico State University)
  abstract: |
    <p>Coupled with the rapid increase in mobile device users and the bandwidth and latency demands are the continuous increase of devices’ processing capabilities, storage, and wireless connectivity options. The multiple radio access technology (multi-RAT) is proposed to satisfy mobile users’ increasing needs. The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm is better tuned (than the current Internet Protocol approach) to support multi-RAT communications. ICN eschews the connection-based content retrieval model used today and has desirable features such as data naming, in-network caching, and device mobility–a paradigm ripe for exploration.</p>
    <p>We propose DICE, an ICN forwarding strategy that helps a device dynamically select a subset of its multi-RAT interfaces for communication. DICE assesses the state of edge links and network congestion to determine the minimum number of interfaces required to perform data delivery. We perform simulations to compare DICE’s performance with bestroute2 and multicast strategies (part of the named data networking simulator, ndnSIM). We show that DICE is the best of both worlds: providing a higher delivery ratio (0.2–2 times) and much lower overhead (by 2–8 times) for different packet rates.</p>

  title: The Named-Object Abstraction for Realizing Advanced Mobility Services in
    the Future Internet
  authors: Francesco Bronzino (Inria, Paris) and Shreyasee Mukherjee and Dipankar
    Raychaudhuri (WINLAB, Rutgers University)
  abstract: |
    <p>This paper presents a new abstraction called “Named-Objects” for enabling flexible and advanced mobility services in the future Internet. The concept of named objects falls under the broad category of “information centric networks (ICN)” and is based on the assignment of a globally unique identifier to all Internet attached objects while separating this “name” from the routable “address” or “locator”. The named object approach is supported by a global name resolution service (GNRS) which dynamically maps names to addresses while also providing supplementary service information where desired. The named object is outlined and exemplary mobility related services including device mobility, multihoming and multicast are discussed and compared with alternative ICN designs.</p>
    <p>A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the named object architecture is given relative to alternative ICN designs such as Content Centric Networking (CCN) as well as name-based protocols evolved from IP, i.e. HIP and LISP. Results of the evaluation are given to demonstrate that the proposed named object abstraction provides superior performance for a sample set of mobility services and this has the potential to serve as a foundation for future mobile network protocols.</p>

  title: Receiver Mobility in Vehicular Named Data Networking
  authors: Joao M. Duarte and Torsten Braun (University of Bern, Switzerland) and
    Leandro A. Villas (University of Campinas, Brazil)
  abstract: "<p>This work investigates the topic of Vehicular Named Data Networking
    (VNDN). We propose a new VNDN routing protocol and address the negative effects
    caused by receiver mobility. In particular, we identify the problem of Reverse
    Path Partitioning (RPP) that often prevents Data messages from reaching Content
    Requesters, degrading application performance. To mitigate RPP we propose a mechanism
    called Auxiliary Forwarding Set (AFS). AFS takes several mobility factors as inputs
    and extends the NDN core philosophy by identifying an extra set of eligible nodes
    to forward Data messages whenever retransmissions are required due to RPP. Simulation
    results show that AFS is an efficient and scalable solution to improve VNDN application
    performance regardless of receiver mobility.</p>\n"
