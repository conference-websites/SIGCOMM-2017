  title: 'ClickP4: Towards Modular Programming of P4'
  authors: Yu Zhou and Jun Bi (Tsinghua University)
  abstract: "<p>P4 extends the boundary of network programmability and enables network
    operators to define device behaviors. However, developing monolithic P4 programs
    from scratch is prone to errors and can be a source of complexity. Furthermore,
    the features implemented by a P4 program can hardly be re-orchestrated at runtime,
    which reduces the flexibility of programmable networks. And there is no isolation
    mechanism for network policies to protect themselves from being enforced by undesired
    features. In this paper, we design and implement ClickP4, a modular programming
    architecture for P4. While incurring a little performance penalty, ClickP4 significantly
    mitigates the complexity of developing P4 programs, flexibly orchestrates program
    features at runtime and offers reliable enforcement of network policies.</p>\n"

  title: A Demonstration of the DeDoS Platform for Defusing Asymmetric DDoS Attacks
    in Data Centers

    University), Isaac Pedisich, Nik Sultana, and Bowen Wang (University of Pennsylvania),

    Sherr, Clay Shields, and Wenchao Zhou (Georgetown University)
  abstract: "<p>We propose a demonstration of DeDoS, a platform for mitigating asymmetric
    DDoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using
    limited resources can exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers.
    DeDoS resolves this by splitting monolithic software stacks into separable components
    called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing
    a DDoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected MSUs, potentially
    across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately
    from the rest of the application stack so that resources can be precisely added
    where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show that DeDoS incurs
    reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantly outperforms
    na√Øve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.</p>\n"

  title: Stateful Layer-4 Load Balancing in Switching ASICs
  authors: Jeongkeun Lee (Barefoot Networks), Rui Miao (University of Southern California),
    Changhoon Kim (Barefoot Networks), Minlan Yu (Yale University), and Hongyi Zeng
    (Facebook)
  abstract: |-
    <p>In this demo, we show that a large number of software based load balancer servers can be replaced by a single modern switching ASIC, potentially reducing the cost of load balancing by two orders of magnitude. Today, large data centers typically employ hundreds or thousands of servers (or around 4% of the data center compute resources) to load-balance incoming traffic over application servers. These software load balancers (SLBs) map packets destined to a service (with a virtual IP address, or VIP), to a pool of servers tasked with providing the service (with multiple direct IP addresses, or DIPs). An SLB is stateful; it must always map a connection to the same server, even if the pool of servers changes and/or if the load is spread differently across the pool. This property is called per-connection consistency or PCC. The challenge is that the load balancer must keep track of millions of connections simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Until recently, it was not possible to implement a load balancer with PCC in a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) switching ASIC, because high-performance switching ASICs typically cannot maintain per-connection states with PCC. Newer switching ASICs provide resources and primitives to enable PCC at a large scale. We present a system, called SilkRoad, that is defined in a 400 line P4 program, and when compiled to a state-of-the-art switching ASIC, it can load-balance millions of connection simultaneously at line rate. Our conference paper details the solution design and evaluates its scale and cost by running trace-driven simulations on the data collected from a large web service provider. The paper also shows the feasibility of storing millions of connection states into a switching ASIC. On top of that, the present two-page abstract shows the full cycle of connection and DIP pool management, explaining the co-design between switch data plane (ASIC) and control plane (software) to enable PCC in switching ASICs.</p>

  title: Boosting the BGP convergence in SDXes with SWIFT
  authors: Philipp Mao, Rudiger Birkner, Thomas Holterbach, and Laurent Vanbever (ETH
    Zurich)
  abstract: "<p>BGP, the only inter-domain routing protocol used today, often converges
    slowly upon outages. While fast-reroute solutions exist, they can only protect
    from local outages, not remote ones (e.g., a failure in a transit network). To
    address this problem, we proposed SWIFT, a fast-reroute framework enabling BGP
    routers to locally restore connectivity upon remote outages by combining fast
    inference mechanisms in the control-plane with fast data plane updates. While
    SWIFTis deployable on a per-router basis, we show in this demonstration that we
    can deploy SWIFT in Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points (SDXes) with a simple
    software update. We show that SWIFTing an SDX is highly beneficial as it enables
    to converge the entire fabric within few seconds instead of the tens of seconds
    required by the original software.</p>\n"

  title: Safeguarding VNF Credentials with Intel SGX
  authors: Nicolae Paladi and Linus Karlsson (RISE SICS)
  abstract: |
    <p>Operators use containers ‚Äì enabled by operating system (OS) level virtualization ‚Äì to deploy virtual network functions (VNFs) that access the centralized network controller in software-defined networking (SDN) deployments. While SDN allows flexible network configuration, it also increases the attack surface on the network deployment. For example, insecure communication channels may be tapped to extract or inject sensitive data transferred on the north-bound interface, between the network controller and VNFs; furthermore, to protect the network controller from malicious VNF instances, the integrity and authenticity of VNFs must be verified prior to deployment.</p>
    <p>To mitigate the risks described above, we implemented a prototype that leverages hardware-based mechanisms for isolated execution implemented by Intel SGX in combination with a run-time integrity measurement subsystem, namely Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). This prototype is a first step towards providing to tenants and end-users integrity guarantees regarding the network components in SDN deployments.</p>
    <p>A video demo of the prototype is available at https://vimeo.com/217788815 .</p>

  title: Automatic Custom Generation of Topologies and Configuration of Routing protocols
    in SDN
  authors: Apoorv Shukla, Mengchen Shi, and Anja Feldmann (TU Berlin)
  abstract: "<p>Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) has been an area of interest among
    researchers from academia and industry. SDNs, however, also introduce new challenges,
    for example researchers work under strict time constraints and need to conduct
    frequent experiments to verify their ideas on scalable simulation of real-life
    topologies. The challenge is two-fold: first, the researchers need to manually
    generate the topologies and second, manually configure the devices in the generated
    topologies to enable routing protocols. We demonstrate two novel tools, namely,
    TOPOLOGY GENERATOR and ENHANCED AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION ROUTEFLOW (EACRF), which
    automatically generate the custom scalable topologies at the SDN data plane and
    configure routing protocols like BGP and OSPF, at the SDN control plane, in a
    seamless fashion in quick time. EACRF is an enhancement of RouteFlow which can
    be used in conjunction with Topology Generator or independently.</p>\n"

  title: 'DPS-Discuss: demonstrating Decentralized, Pseudonymous, Sybil-resistant
    communication'
  authors: Sebastian Friebe (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)) and Martin Florian
    (Bundesdruckerei GmbH)
  abstract: |
    <p>A current trend on the Internet is the increasing surveillance of its users. A few big service providers have divided most of the user-facing Internet between them, observing and recording the activities of their users to increase profits. Additionally, government agencies have been found to practice mass surveillance.</p>
    <p>With regard to this it becomes even more important to provide online services that protect the privacy of their users and avoid censorship by single, powerful entities. To reach these goals, a trusted third party should be avoided. A prototype service which fulfills these goals is DPS-Discuss, a decentralized, pseudonymous online discussion application. It uses the libraries BitNym and Peer-Tor-Peer for pseudonym management and anonymous communication.</p>

  title: Enhancing Mobile Video Delivery over an Heterogeneous Network Access with
    Information-Centric Networking

    Carofiglio, Luca Muscariello, and Michele Papalini (Cisco Systems), and Mauro
    Sardara (Cisco Systems/T√©l√©com Paristech)
  abstract: "<p>Mobile video delivery drives Internet traffic evolution and puts colossal
    pressure on future 5G networks to support higher quality and lower latency requirements
    over an increasingly heterogeneous network access. Moreover the increasing part
    of mobile devices in the overall video traffic emphasizes how future network architectures
    should cope with heterogeneous accesses. Given this context, Future Internet paradigms
    recentering communication around content, such as Information Centric Networks
    (ICN), appear as promising candidates to relieve the challenges of a mobility-robust,
    efficient and cost-effective video delivery, by integrating video-awareness at
    network layer. In this demo, we focus on ICN-enabled Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
    (DAS) over an heterogeneous wireless access. We integrate ICN capabilities in
    DAS clients requesting 4K video content to standard DAS servers. We deploy a virtualized
    ICN-enabled network slice using LXC containers to connect clients to servers through
    an heterogeneous wireless access (including 802.11n and LTE emulated radios) and
    a simplified backhaul. The contribution of the demo is twofold. First it showcases
    what ICN can bring to DAS over a mobile heterogeneous access in virtue of its
    content-awareness at network layer. Second, it offers to the user a rich sandbox
    where several state-of-the-art DAS controllers are implemented and can be tested
    over ICN or standard TCP.</p>\n"

  abstract: |
    <p>Recently, Software-Defined Networking has grown out of being an ‚Äúintriguing approach‚Äù and turned into a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù for communication networks to overcome many long-standing problems of traditional networking. However, there are still some obstacles on the way to the widespread adoption. Current commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDN offerings are still in their infancy as being notorious of lacking standards compliance, scalability, and unpredictable performance indicators compared to their legacy counterparts. On the other hand, recent software based solutions might mitigate these pain factors, but in terms of cost-efficiency and port density they are in a different league.</p>
    <p>Here, we present HARMLESS, a novel SDN switch design that combines the rapid innovation and upgrade cycles of software switches with the port density of hardware-based appliances into a fully data plane-transparent, vendor-neutral and cost-effective solution for smaller enterprises to gain a foothold in this era. The demo showcases the SDN migration of a dumb legacy Ethernet switch to a powerful, fully reconfigurable, OpenFlow-enabled network device without incurring any major performance and latency penalty nor any substantial price tag enabling to realize many use cases that would have needed standalone hardware appliances before.</p>

  title: SDN/NFV-enabled Security Architecture for Fine-grained Policy Enforcement
    and Threat Mitigation for Enterprise Networks
  authors: Benedikt Pfaff, Johann Scherer, and David Hock (Infosim GmbH), Nicholas
    Gray, Thomas Zinner, and Phuoc Tran-Gia (University of Wuerzburg), Raphael Durner
    and Wolfgang Kellerer (Technical University of Munich), and Claas Lorenz (genua
    GmbH)
  abstract: |
    <p>Today, network security in enterprises is mainly enforced by firewalls guarding the perimeter of the network against an ever increasing number of cyber threats. While inspecting and enforcing security policies on every flow entering or leaving the network, Perimeter Gateway Firewalls (PFG) provide hardly any defense against attacks originating from and targeting the inside of the network. Thus, once the perimeter is breached attackers and malware can easily compromise additional hosts as we have seen in the recent outbreak of the WannaCry worm.</p>
    <p>To mitigate such outbreaks, enterprises usually rely on costly Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and a centralized update management to install security updates in a timely manner. Both systems aim to minimize the window, in which the enterprise network is susceptible to attacks. Yet, this is a tedious process as the IPS requires an attack signature and changes to the software stack demands thorough testing. Furthermore, in the case of ZeroDay attacks no signatures and updates are available. Hence, this often results in a widened window in which the network remains vulnerable and an increased risk.</p>
    <p>A complimentary approach to alleviate these threats is to quarantine malicious hosts on a network level, as this can be deployed immediately and is independent from the update procedure. To accomplish this, a fine-grained flow selection and security control is needed. Whereas architectures such as Ethane and more recent technologies like Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtulization (NFV) provide this required granularity, the adaptation of thsi technologies in enterprise networks remains limited. This is due to the fact, that the integration of new technologies into an existing network infrastructure is a highly complex task, as the compatibility with systems such as network management and cloud management system has to be assured for production environments.</p>
    <p>In this work, we demonstrate the prospects of seamlessly integrating SDN and NFV based security operations into the existing enterprise network infrastructure to provide state-of-the-art stateful firewalling for advanced packet filtering as well as on-demand fine-grained flow separation and isolation for the exterior and interior network. This is achieved by levering an omnipresent firewall which is based on cloud principles enabling enhanced scalability and resilience, while simultaneously cutting down on Operation Expenses (OpEx). We illustrate the advantages of the implemented security architecture by the example of Bring-Your-Own-Device use case.</p>
    <p>In the following, we present the involved architectural components and outline the planned demonstration detailing fine-grained access control, firewall offloading for further optimization and the integration into a network management system.</p>

  title: Fine-grained RFID Localization via Ultra-wideband Emulation
  authors: Yunfei Ma, Nicholas Selby, Manish Singh, and Fadel Adib (MIT)
  abstract: "<p>This demo presents RFind, a system that enables fine-grained RFID
    localization via ultra-wideband emulation. RFind operates by measuring the time-of-flight
    ‚Äì i.e., the time it takes the signal to travel from an antenna to an RFID tag.
    To do so, it emulates an ultrawide bandwidth on today‚Äôs narrowband RFIDs without
    requiring any hardware modification to the tags. It then uses the large emulated
    bandwidth to estimate the time-of-flight and localize RFIDs. In contrast to past
    RFID localization proposals, RFind can operate in multipath-rich environments
    without reference tags and without requiring tag or antenna motion. The demo will
    allow users to move RFID-tagged objects to any location in line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight,
    and multi-path rich settings and check that the system can accurately localize
