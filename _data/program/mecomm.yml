  title: 'Virtualization and Programmability in Mobile Wireless Networks: Architecture
    and Resource Management'
  authors: Kleber V. Cardoso (Universidade Federal de Goias), Mohammad J. Abdel-Rahman
    (Virginia Tech), Allen B. MacKenzie (Virginia Tech), Luiz A. DaSilva (Trinity
    College Dublin)
  abstract: |-
    We present a high-level end-to-end architecture for virtualization
    and programmability in next-generation mobile wireless networks.
    Our architecture envisions three major players: Service Providers,
    who wish to orchestrate wireless networks with particular characteristics to support particular applications; Resource Providers,
    who contribute resources such as spectrum, access points, backhaul
    infrastructure, and computing; and Virtual Network Builders, who
    marshal resources into networks for Service Providers. We take into
    account resource sharing and investigate how virtualization and
    programmability affect resource management. We show that: (i)
    virtualization reduces cost signifcantly, (ii) this cost reduction does
    not degrade the user satisfaction, and (iii) non-virtualized networks
    need to keep a large amount of idle capacity to satisfy coverage.

    Connected vehicle systems form the basis for future features of
    functions and applications within the automotive domain. In order
    to allow resource intensive services, cloud offloading and especially
    Mobile Edge Computing is a promising approach. In this paper, we
    present a detailed futuristic vehicular scenario – Electronic Horizon – and list the challenges. We argue that the resulting challenges are
    representative of many of the envisioned use-cases of Mobile Edge
    Computing. We then present how Information-Centric Networking
    in combination with Mobile Edge Computing has the potential to
    support such a futuristic scenario. Finally, we present research
    directions that could enhance the solution space.

  abstract: |-
    Wi-Fi, the most commonly used access technology at the very edge,
    supports download speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than
    the average home broadband or cellular data connection. Furthermore, it is extremely common for users to be within reach of their
    neighbours’ Wi-Fi access points. Given the skewed nature of interest in content items, it is likely that some of these neighbours
    are interested in the same items as the users. We sketch the design
    of Wi-Stitch, an architecture that exploits these observations to
    construct a highly efficient content sharing infrastructure at the
    very edge and show through analysis of a real workload that it can
    deliver substantial (up to 70%) savings in network traffic. The Wi-Stitch approach can be used both by clients of fixed-line broadband,
    as well as mobile devices obtaining indoors access in converged
    networks.

  title: Managing Data in Computational Edge Clouds

  abstract: |-
    Edge clouds handle data and computations closer to its source
    and users. Applications like industrial automation, bring new
    challenges and require solutions tailored for computation-centric edge cloud networks. In this paper we build on existing edge and fog computing models and develop a solution
    to predict and store data in edge resource caches for upcoming computations. Our solution is based on grouping caches
    according to the workloads they serve. We further develop
    methods for populating the caches and ensuring the coherence of the cached data. We evaluate the performance of
    our grouping mechanisms and show that they bring significant performance gains, both in terms of network traffic and
    access latency.

  title: Mobility-based Proactive Multicast for seamless mobility support in cellular
    network environments

  abstract: |-
    Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is receiver driven, asynchronous and location-independent, hence it natively supports
    client-mobility. However, post-handover delay is a problem for
    delay-sensitive mobile applications, as they need to (re-)submit
    their subscriptions and wait for them to get resolved and (probably
    re-) transmitted before receiving the demanded data. To avoid this
    problem and optimize performance, this paper proposes a Mobility-based Proactive Multicast (MPM) scheme. Unlike reactive or blind
    multicast solutions proposed in the past, MPM takes autonomous
    decisions locally at various network access points (cells) prior to
    the movement of mobile clients, using a semi-Markov mobility
    prediction model that predicts next-cell transitions, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions for an arbitrary user
    in a cellular network. Since cellular backhaul links are typically
    a bottleneck, MPM trades-off effectively part of the capacity of
    the (congested) backhaul link for a decreased delay experienced
    by users after handovers thanks to a congestion pricing scheme
    used for backhaul capacity allocation. Our preliminary performance
    evaluation results show that MPM captures well the temporal locality of mobile requests due to the semi-Markov mobility prediction model, hence it achieves a better performance compared to both a (i)
    blind/naïve multicast and a (ii) content popularity-based proactive multicast.

  title: Optimization of Webpage Downloading Performance with Content-aware Mobile
    Edge Computing

  abstract: |-
    With increased complexity of webpages nowadays, computation
    latency incurred by webpage processing during downloading operations has become a newly identi�ed factor that may substantially aff�ect user experiences in a mobile network. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a simple but e�ective transport-layer optimization
    technique which requires necessary context information dissemination from the mobile edge computing (MEC) server to user devices
    where such an algorithm is actually executed. The key novelty in
    this case is the mobile edge’s knowledge about webpage content
    characteristics which is able to increase downloading throughput
    for user QoE enhancement. Our experiment results based on a real
    LTE-A test-bed show that, when the proportion of computation
    latency varies between 20% and 50% (which is typical for today’s
    webpages), the downloading throughput can be improved up to
    34.5%, with reduced downloading time by up to 25.1%

  title: Realization of CDMA-based IoT Services with Shared Band Operation of LTE

  abstract: |-
    5G network is geared towards massive deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) with requirements of low end-to-end latency, low
    control overhead and low power transmissions. Current 4G network is optimized for large bandwidth applications and inefficient
    to handle short sporadic IoT messages. This paper focuses on low power underlay CDMA access for IoT devices considering event-driven and latency sensitive traffic profile, thus will significantly
    reduce the access time. We propose a PHY/MAC layer design for CDMA based communication for IoT devices. We evaluate coexisting operation of CDMA based IoT network in presence of the
    exiting LTE network. Our proposed protocol will integrate IoT traffic with legacy system by minimal modification at the edge network, essentially eNodeB. We show that the underlay CDMA IoT network meets IoT data traffic requirements with minimal degradation
    (~ 3%) to the LTE throughput. We also implement the proposed design using Software Defined Radios and show the viability of the proposal under different network scenarios.

  title: Geo-partitioning of MEC resources
  authors: Mathieu Bouet (Thales), Vania Conan (Thales)
  abstract: "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging technology that\naims at pushing
    applications and content close to the users (e.g.\nat base stations, access points,
    aggregation networks) to reduce\nlatency, improve quality of experience, and ensure
    highly effi\x81cient\nnetwork operation and service delivery.  It principally
    relies on\nvirtualization-enabled MEC servers with limited capacity at the\nedge
    of the network. One key issue is to dimension such systems\nin terms of server
    size, server number and server operation area\nto meet MEC goals. In this paper,
    we propose a graph-based algorithm that, taking into account a maximum MEC server
    capacity,\nprovides a partition of MEC clusters, which consolidates as many\ncommunications
    as possible at the edge. We use a dataset of mobile communications to evaluate
    it with real world spatio-temporal\nhuman dynamics.  In addition to quantifying
    macroscopic MEC\nbene\x80ts, the evaluation shows that our algorithm provides
    MEC\narea partitions that largely ofload the core, thus pushing the load at\nthe
    edge (e.g., with 10 small MEC servers around 55% of the tra\x81ffic\nstay at the
    edge), and that are well balanced through time."

  title: 'RAERA: A Robust Auctioning Approach for Edge Resource Allocation'
  authors: Abhinandan S. Prasad (University of Goettingen), Mayutan Arumaithurai (University
    of Goettingen), David Koll (University of Goettingen), Xiaoming Fu (University
    of Goettingen, Germany)
  abstract: |-
    In edge computing, content and service providers aim at enhancing user experience by providing services closer to the user. At
    the same time, infrastructure providers such as access ISPs aim
    at utilizing their infrastructure by selling edge resources to these
    content and service providers. In this context, auctions are widely
    used to set a price that reflects supply and demand in a fair way. In
    this work, we propose RAERA, the first robust auction scheme for
    edge resource allocation that is suitable to work with the market
    uncertainty typical for edge resources—here, customers typically
    have different valuation distribution for a wide range of heterogeneous resources. Additionally, RAERA encourages truthful bids
    and allows the infrastructure provider to maximize its break-even
    profit. Our preliminary evaluations highlight that REARA offers a
    time dependent fair price. Sellers can achieve higher revenue in the
    range of 5%-15% irrespective of varying demands and the buyers
    pay up to 20% lower than their top bid amount.

  title: 'SDLB: A Scalable and Dynamic Software Load Balancer for Fog and Mobile Edge
    Computing'
  authors: Ye Yu (University of Kentucky), Xin Li (University of California, Santa
    Cruz), Chen Qian (University of California, Santa Cruz)
  abstract: |-
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides computing/storage
    offloading and resource virtualization to mobile devices
    at the network edge. A load balancer is a necessary network function to determine the destination MEC host of
    each packet from a mobile device, for such virtualization.
    Due to the new characteristics of MEC, such as resource
    limitation and high dynamics, existing solutions of cloud
    load balancer cannot be directly applied to MEC. This
    paper presents a new design of a Scalable and Dynamic
    Load Balancer, called SDLB, that satisfies the require-
    ments of MEC. The core algorithm of SDLB is minimal
    perfect hashing, which provides two perfect features as
    a load balancer. Evaluation results show that SDLB is
    faster by 4x to 10x and uses much less (< 50%) memory,
    than a widely-used load balancer design for cloud.
