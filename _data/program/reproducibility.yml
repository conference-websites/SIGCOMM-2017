  title: 'Challenges with Reproducibility '
  authors: Vaibhav Bajpai (TU Munich); Mirja Kühlewind (ETH Zürich); Jörg Ott (TU
    Munich); Jürgen Schönwälder (Jacobs University Bremen); Anna Sperotto (University
    of Twente); Brian Trammell (ETH Zürich)
  abstract: The Computer Science (CS) culture is gentle to accepting papers that are
    non-reproducible as long as they appear plausible. In this paper, we discuss some
    of the challenges with reproducibility and a set of recommendations that we as
    a community can undertake to initiate a cultural change.

  title: Towards an Ecosystem for Reproducible Research in Computer Networking
  authors: Quirin Scheitle (Technical University of Munich); Matthias Wählisch (Freie
    Universität Berlin); Oliver Gasser (Technical University of Munich); Thomas C.
    Schmidt (HAW Hamburg); Georg Carle (Technical University of Munich)
  abstract: Reproducibility is key to rigorous scientific progress. However, many
    publications in the computer networks community lack support for reproducibility.
    In this paper, we argue that the lack is mainly rooted in the additional effort
    that authors need to spend, without expecting sufficient benefits. Based on our
    experience in both authoring reproducible research and reproducing publications,
    we propose an ecosystem that incentivizes authors and reproducers to invest additional
    effort. This ecosystem consists of various building blocks, which can be combined
    into venue-specific profiles. A key building block is the Reproducibility Challenge,
    which we suggest to co-locate with annual SIGCOMM conference to leverage reproducibility
    research in practice.

  title: Learning Reproducibility with a Yearly Networking Contest
  authors: Marco Canini (KAUST); Jon Crowcroft (University of Cambridge)
  abstract: Better reproducibility of networking research results is currently a major
    goal that the academic community is striving towards. This position paper makes
    the case that improving the extent and pervasiveness of reproducible research
    can be greatly fostered by organizing a yearly international contest. We argue
    that holding a contest undertaken by a plurality of students will have benefits
    that are two-fold. First, it will promote hands-on learning of skills that are
    helpful in producing artifacts at the replicable-research level. Second, it will
    advance the best practices regarding environments, testbeds, and tools that will
    aid the tasks of reproducibility evaluation committees by and large.

  title: Taming the complexity of artifact reproducibility
  authors: Matthias Flittner, Robert Bauer (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology); Amr
    Rizk (Technische Universität Darmstadt); Stefan Geißler, Thomas Zinner (University
    of Würzburg); Martina Zitterbart (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)
  abstract: Reproducing research results, as it is required for peer review, can be
    a time-consuming and difficult task. In this work, we propose three approaches
    to improve the way of how research results can be substantiated and discuss their
    applicability. Our proposals are based on a brief study on evaluation methods
    (for SDN research) and insights from a comprehensive discussion on reproducibility.

  title: 'Best of CCR: Learning Networking by Reproducing Research Results'
  authors: Lisa Yan (Stanford University)
  abstract: In the past five years, the graduate networking course at Stanford has
    assigned over 200 students the task of repro- ducing results from over 40 networking
    papers. We began the project as a means of teaching both engineering rigor and
    critical thinking, qualities that are necessary for careers in networking research
    and industry. We have observed that reproducing research can simultaneously be
    a tool for edu- cation and a means for students to contribute to the net- working
    community. Through this editorial we describe our project in reproducing network
    research and show through anecdotal evidence that this project is important for
    both the classroom and the networking community at large, and we hope to encourage
    other institutions to host similar class pro jects.

  title: A Meta-Analysis Approach for Feature Selection in Network Traffic Research
  authors: Daniel C. Ferreira, Félix Iglesias, Gernot Vormayr, Maximilian Bachl, Tanja
    Zseby (TU Wien)
  abstract: The selection of features for network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection
    is a challenge for experts who aim to build systems that discover traffic patterns,
    characterize networks, and improve security. There are no major guidelines or
    best practices for feature selection in the field. The literature is full of different
    proposals that ultimately depend on feature availability, types of known traffic,
    tool limitations, specific goals, and, fundamentally, the experts’ knowledge and
    intuition. In this work we have revisited 71 principal publications from 2005
    to 2017. Relevant information has been curated according to formalized data structures
    and stored in JSON format, creating a database for the smart retrieval of network
    traffic analysis researches. Meta-analysis performed upon the explored publications
    disclosed a set of main features that are common in a considerable volume of works
    and could be used as a baseline for future research. Additionally, aiming for
    validation and generalization in network traffic research, the creation of such
    meta-analysis environments is highly required. It allows homogenizing and joining
    criteria for the design of experiments and tools, thus avoiding getting lost or
    becoming irrelevant due to the high complexity and variability that network traffic
    analysis involves.

  title: Lessons Learned while Trying to Reproduce the OpenRF Experiment
  authors: Mohamed Naoufal Mahfoudi, Thierry Turletti, Thierry Parmentelat, Walid
    Dabbous (Université Côte d’Azur, Inria, France)
  abstract: Evaluating and comparing performance of wireless systems, like for any
    other scientific area, requires the ability to reproduce experimental results.
    In this paper, we describe the specific issues that we encountered when focusing
    on reproducing the experiments described in a paper related to wireless systems.
    We selected the OpenRF paper published in SIGCOMM 2013, a very interesting research
    work allowing to perform beamforming on commodity WiFi devices. We illustrate
    how reproducibility is strongly dependent on the used hardware, and why an extensive
    knowledge of the used hardware and its design is necessary. On the basis of this
    experience, we propose some recommendations and lessons for the design of reproducible
    wireless experiments.

  title: Testbeds Support for Reproducible Research
  authors: Lucas Nussbaum (LORIA - INRIA - Université de Lorraine)
  abstract: In the context of experimental research, testbeds play an important role
    in enabling reproducibility of experiments, by providing a set of services that
    help experiments with setting up the experimental environment, and collecting
    data about it. This paper explores the status of three different testbeds (Chameleon,
    CloudLab and Grid'5000) regarding features required for, or related to reproducible
    research, and discusses some open questions on that topic.
