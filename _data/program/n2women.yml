  title: 'The Internet: A complex system at its limits'
  authors: Anja Feldman
  abstract: 'While the Internet is a hugely successful, human made artifact that has
    changed the society fundamentally, it has become a complex system with many challenges.
    In this talk I will outline some of them and also point out a number of surprises
    in terms of our mental models of the Internet that we develop over the years.
    Next, I will focus on the evolution of the Internet and discuss methods for detecting
    Internet infrastructure outages, how to extend software-defined networking concepts
    to wireless networking, how to achieve predictable performance in distributed
    systems. I will end with an outlook on how we may evolve the Internet to tackle
    the future challenges of ubiquitous data availability from sensors and devices
    everywhere.

  title: 'The minority advantages: Benefits of being a female professor in science'
  authors: Wenjing Lou
  abstract: "Being female in a male-dominated profession is oftentimes perceived as
    a disadvantage. Special challenges we face can include work-life balance, relations
    with other colleagues, perceived discrimination, alienation, and exclusion, etc.
    At the same time, we know that diversity is critical to ensure a robust community
    and we have seen continuous effort being made to increase diversity and inclusion
    at different levels.  \nIn this talk, I will share my 14 years of career experience
    as a female science professor. I will discuss my views on how being a minority
    can be an advantage in your career development, and ways to make it happen (i.e.,
    a recipe of turning the lemons into lemonade). In addition, in my role as a NSF
    program director, this talk will also offer a broad view of wireless networking
    and security research and funding opportunities from the perspective of NSF investment
    in these areas. "
  bio: Wenjing Lou is a Fellow of the IEEE and a Professor of Computer Science at
    Virginia Tech. Her research interests include wireless networks and cyber security.
    Since August 2014, Prof. Lou has been serving as a program director at the US
    National Science Foundation (NSF). At NSF, her responsibilities include the Networking
    Technology and Systems (NeTS) program, a core program of the Computer and Network
    Systems (CNS) division within the Directorate for Computer & Information Science
    & Engineering (CISE), and the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program,
    a cross-cutting security program led by CISE/CNS.
