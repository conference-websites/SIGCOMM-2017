  title: Quality of Experience Demystified
  authors: Oliver Hohlfeld (RWTH Aachen University)
  abstract: "<p>Many Internet applications are designed to be used by humans. Yet
    common performance metrics applied to evaluate and optimize these applications
    do not consider aspects of human perception. They rather measure machine-centric
    performance aspects. To solve this, Quality of Experience (QoE) research aims
    at providing human-centric performance evaluation techniques. Yet, many myths
    and misconceptions exist on what QoE really is, how it can be applied, and how
    research can be performed in the QoE domain. These myths are often rooted in translation
    problems between networking and QoE research, two fields having their own language,
    concepts, and venues. This talk aims at bridging the gap and motivating research
    in the field by demystifying the concept of QoE.</p>"

  title: A QoE Perspective on HTTP/2 Server Push
  authors: Torsten Zimmermann, Benedikt Wolters, and Oliver Hohlfeld (RWTH Aachen
    University)
  abstract: "<p>HTTP/2 was recently standardized to optimize the Web by promising
    faster Page Load Times (PLT) as compared to the widely deployed HTTP/1.1. One
    promising feature is HTTP/2 server push, which turns the former pull-only into
    a push-enabled Web. By enabling servers to preemptively push resources to the
    clients without explicit request, it promises further improvements of the overall
    PLT. Despite this potential, it remains unknown if server push can indeed yield
    human perceivable improvements. In this paper, we address this open question by
    assessing server push in both i) a laboratory and ii) a crowdsourcing study. Our
    study assesses the question if server push can lead to perceivable faster PLTs
    as compared to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 without push. We base this study on a set of
    28 push-enabled real-word websites selected in an Internet-wide measurement. Our
    results reveal that our subjects are able to perceive utilization of server push.
    However, its usage does not necessarily accomplish perceived PLT improvements
    and can sometimes even be noticeably detrimental.</p>\n"

  title: 'PAIN: A Passive Web Speed Indicator for ISPs'
  authors: Martino Trevisan, Idilio Drago, and Marco Mellia (Politecnico di Torino)
  abstract: "<p>Understanding the quality of web browsing enjoyed by users is key
    to optimize services and keep users’ loyalty. This is crucial for Internet Service
    Providers (ISPs) to anticipate problems. Quality is subjective, and the complexity
    of today’s pages challenges its measurement. OnLoad time and SpeedIndex are notable
    attempts to quantify web performance. However, these metrics are computed using
    browser instrumentation and, thus, are not available to ISPs. PAIN (PAssive INdicator)
    is an automatic system to observe the performance of web pages at ISPs. It leverages
    passive flow-level and DNS measurements which are still available in the network
    despite the deployment of HTTPS. With unsupervised learning, PAIN automatically
    creates a model from the timeline of requests issued by browsers to render web
    pages, and uses it to analyze the web performance in real-time. We compare PAIN
    to indicators based on in-browser instrumentation and find strong correlations
    between the approaches. It reflects worsening network conditions and provides
    visibility into web performance for ISPs.</p>\n"

  title: Perceived Performance of Top Retail Webpages In the Wild
  authors: Qingzhu Gao, Prasenjit Dey, and Parvez Ahammad (INSTART LOGIC INC)
  abstract: |
    <p>Clearly, no one likes webpages with poor quality of experience (QoE). Being perceived as slow or fast is a key element in the overall perceived QoE of web applications. While extensive effort has been put into optimizing web applications (both in industry and academia), not a lot of work exists in characterizing what aspects of webpage loading process truly influence human end-user’s perception of the <em>Speed</em> of a page. In this paper we present <em>SpeedPerception</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, a large-scale web performance crowdsourcing framework focused on understanding the perceived loading performance of above-the-fold (ATF) webpage content. Our end goal is to create free open-source benchmarking datasets to advance the systematic analysis of how humans perceive webpage loading process.</p>
    <p>In Phase-1 of our <em>SpeedPerception</em> study using Internet Retailer Top 500 (IR 500) websites <span class="citation"></span>, we found that commonly used navigation metrics such as <em>onLoad</em> and <em>Time To First Byte (TTFB)</em> fail (less than 60% match) to represent majority human perception when comparing the speed of two webpages. We present a simple 3-variable-based machine learning model that explains the majority end-user choices better (with <span class="math inline">87 ± 2%</span> accuracy). In addition, our results suggest that the time needed by end-users to evaluate relative perceived speed of webpage is far less than the time of its <em>visualComplete</em> event.</p>

  title: Perspectives on Internet-QoE from the Vantage Point of a CDN Operator
  authors: Marcelo Torres (Akamai)
  abstract: "<p>A content distribution network (CDN) delivers transactions to end-users
    on behalf of its customers, also known as content providers. It follows that content
    providers have a primary role in shaping the view CDNs have of Internet QoE.  Partnerships
    with ISPs and carriers around the world are also critical to a CDNs ability to
    operate. It’s important that CDNs make decisions that meet the mutual goals of
    carriers and CDNs alike. As a fundamental component of the overall physical and
    logical infrastructure, CDNs have a responsibility to the collective Internet.
    The policies driven by content providers and Internet Service Providers are important
    factors that guide how CDNs use active and passive measurements to make instantaneous
    control decisions that ultimately determine an end-users Internet QoE. In this
    Keynote, we look at these perspectives from the vantage point of a CDN operator.
    We take a historical perspective on the way in which customers evaluate the performance
    delivered to their clients, describe measurement strategies applied by different
    classes of our customers, and provide some perspective on how these measurements
    have become increasingly more sophisticated over time. We describe elements of
    the Mapping control system that govern how Akamai’s CDN operates, provide some
    perspective on the measurements that drive the decision-making made by this control
    system, and how these measurements have evolved to meet a richer application specific
    and end-user focused Internet QoE landscape. We expect that this subject matter
    might help provide some insight into measurement challenges facing the industry
    today and in the future.</p>"

  title: Server and Content Selection for MPEG DASH Video Streaming with Client Information
  authors: Florian Wamser, Steffen Höfner, Michael Seufert, and Phuoc Tran-Gia (University
    of Würzburg)
  abstract: "<p>In HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS), such as MPEG DASH, the video is
    split into chunks and is available in different quality levels. If the video chunks
    are stored or cached on different servers to deal with the high load in the network
    and the Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements of the users, the problem of
    content selection arises. In this paper, we evaluate client-side algorithms for
    dynamically selecting an appropriate content server during DASH video streaming.
    We present three algorithms with which the DASH client itself can determine the
    most appropriate server based on client-specific metrics, like actual latency
    or bandwidth to the content servers. We evaluate and discuss the proposed algorithms
    with respect to the resulting DASH streaming behavior in terms of buffer levels
    and quality level selection.</p>\n"

  title: On the Bitrate Adaptation of Shared Media Experience Services
  authors: Argyrios G. Tasiopoulos (University College London), Ray Atarashi (IIJ
    Innovation Institute), and Ioannis Psaras and George Pavlou (University College
    London)
  abstract: "<p>In Shared Media Experience Services (SMESs), a group of people is
    interested in streaming consumption in a synchronised way, like in the case of
    cloud gaming, live streaming, and interactive social applications. However, group
    synchronisation comes at the expense of other Quality of Experience (QoE) factors
    due to both the dynamic and diverse network conditions that each group member
    experiences. Someone might wonder if there is a way to keep a group synchronised
    while maintaining the highest possible QoE for each one of its members. In this
    work, at first we create a Quality Assessment Framework capable of evaluating
    different SMESs improvement approaches with respect to traditional metrics like
    media bitrate quality, playback disruption, and end user desynchronisation. Secondly,
    we focus on the bitrate adaptation for improving the QoE of SMESs, as an incrementally
    deployable end user triggered approach, and we formulate the problem in the context
    of Adaptive Real Time Dynamic Programming (ARTDP). Finally, we develop and apply
    a simple QoE aware bitrate adaptation mechanism that we compare against youtube
    live-streaming traces to find that it improves the youtube performance by more
    than 30</p>\n"

  abstract: "<p>Video streaming is a huge and growing contributor to Internet traffic.
    Netflix alone accounts for over 37% of peak download traffic in the United States.
    This talk will give an overview on how Netflix video streaming works, and how
    Netflix optimizes the streaming experience. We will touch upon how Netflix accelerates
    its control traffic, how video assets are distributed and streamed over the Internet,
    and how video quality is dynamically adapted to avoid interruptions. We will also
    talk about Fast.com, generic Internet speed test that is powered by Netflix infrastructure.</p>"

  title: Unleashing the Potential of Data-Driven Networking
  authors: Vyas Sekar (CMU)
  abstract: "<p>The last few years have witnessed the coming of age of data-driven
    paradigm in various aspects of computing (partly) empowered by advances in distributed
    system research (cloud computing, MapReduce, etc). In this paper, we observe that
    the benefits can flow the opposite direction: the design and management of networked
    systems and especially Quality of Experience can be improved by the data-driven
    paradigm. To this end, we present DDN, a new design framework that has the potential
    to significantly achieve better performance through harnessing more data than
    one single flow. In this talk, I will try to systematize existing instantiations
    of DDN by creating a unified framework for DDN, and use the framework to shed
    light on the common challenges and reusable design principles. We believe that
    by systematizing this paradigm as a broader community, we can unleash the unharnessed
    potential of DDN for QoE optimization.</p>"

  title: On active sampling of controlled experiments for QoE modeling
  authors: Muhammad Jawad Khokhar, Nawfal Abbasi Saber, Thierry Spetebroot, and Chadi
    Barakat (INRIA, France)
  abstract: "<p>For internet applications, measuring, modeling and predicting the
    quality experienced by end users as a function of network conditions is challenging.
    A common approach for building application specific Quality of Experience (QoE)
    models is to rely on controlled experimentation. For accurate QoE modeling, this
    approach can result in a large number of experiments to carry out because of the
    multiplicity of the network features, their large span (e.g., bandwidth, delay)
    and the time needed to setup the experiments themselves. However, most often,
    the space of network features in which experimentations are carried out shows
    a high degree of uniformity in the training labels of QoE. This uniformity, difficult
    to predict beforehand, amplifies the training cost with little or no improvement
    in QoE modeling accuracy. So, in this paper, we aim to exploit this uniformity,
    and propose a methodology based on active learning, to sample the experimental
    space intelligently, so that the training cost of experimentation is reduced.
    We prove the feasibility of our methodology by validating it over a particular
    case of YouTube streaming, where QoE is modeled both in terms of interruptions
    and stalling duration.</p>\n"

  title: Designing a Survey Tool for Monitoring Enterprise QoE
  authors: Kathrin Borchert, Matthias Hirth, and Thomas Zinner (University of Würzburg)
    and Anja Göritz (Freiburg University)
  abstract: |
    <p>Enterprise applications like SAP are part of the day-to-day work of a large number of employees. Similar to many modern applications, enterprise applications are often implemented in a distributed fashion and consequently suffer from network degradations resulting in impairments like increased loading delays. While the influence of these impairments on the perceived quality of users is well researched for consumer applications and network services, the impact of these impairments in a business environment is yet to be investigated.</p>
    <p>To address this gap we develop a non-intrusive software tool for continuously collecting subjective ratings on the performance of an enterprise application from a large number of employees. Based on the feedback from a company and results from two initial field studies we discuss the specific challenges when assessing the perceived quality of employees during regular working hours and point out our further research directions.</p>
