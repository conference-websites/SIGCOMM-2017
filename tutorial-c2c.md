### Call For Participation

In this tutorial lecture, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of the Tactile Internet and its fundamental concepts. Early 5G research was mainly about big data pipes and further increasing possible data rates in cellular as well as access networks. This situation changes. Current research towards 5G networks and the Tactile Internet focuses primarily on two core aspects: providing ultra-low latency as well as ultra-high reliability. Among many others, distributed control is considered a target application for such networking technologies. In the scope of this tutorial, we concentrate on connected cars as a prominent example â€“ other include industry automation and smart city operations. In this scenario, short range radio broadcast as well as direct machine to machine communication will play a major role. The Tactile Internet activities are now coordinated by the IEEE Communications Society Tactile Internet Sub-Committee.

Looking back at the last decade, one can observe enormous progress in the domain of vehicular networking. In this growing community, many ongoing activities focus on the design of communication protocols to support safety applications, intelligent navigation, multi-player gaming and others. Very large projects have been initiated to validate the theoretic work in field tests and protocols are being standardized. With the increasing interest from industry, security and privacy have also become crucial aspects in the stage of protocol design in order to support a smooth and carefully planned roll-out. Researchers from academia and industry recently met at an international Dagstuhl seminar to discuss open research challenges as well as open issues related to market-oriented design. We are now entering an era that might change the game in road traffic management. This is supported by the U.S. federal government announcement in February 2014 that National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to begin working on a regulatory proposal that would require V2V devices in new vehicles in a future year. This NHTSA announcement coincides with the final standardization of higher layer networking protocols in Europe by the ETSI.

We will primarily discuss the challenges and opportunities of the connected cars vision in relation to some of the most needed components in modern smart cities: improved road traffic safety combined with reduced travel times and emissions. Using selected application examples including the use of virtual traffic lights, intelligent intersection management, and platooning, we assess the needs on the underlying system components with a particular focus on inter-vehicle communication. We also shed light on the potentials of a vehicular cloud based on parked vehicles as a spatio-temporal network and storage infrastructure. Vehicular networking solutions have been investigated for more than a decade but recent standardization efforts just enable a broad use of this technology to build large scale Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). One of the key questions is whether some pre-deployed infrastructure is needed to enable and to boost vehicular networks. We see many benefits in such infrastructure to store information and to provide connectivity among the vehicles. Yet, instead of using Roadside Units (RSUs), we envision to rely on parked vehicles to provide such vehicular cloud services.

The tutorial is supported by a textbook on "Vehicular Networking" authored by Falko Dressler that will be published just ahead of the tutorial lecture by Cambridge Press.
